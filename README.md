Can sentiment be a leading factor in determining the price of a stock? 

To answer this interesting question, I decided to test my hypothesis (that sentiment as a factor does indeed influence a stock’s price) by developing my own back-test. 

The testing of these strategies relies on using sentiment data from Quandl.com

Even though this database has  free ‘demo’ sentiment data, unfortunately, if you want to back-test further into the past, you will need to pay for this.
